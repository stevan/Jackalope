== KNOWN ISSUES ==

- Jackalope::Schema::Respository
    - extending a self referencing schema in a properties is not allowed
      but you can do it in links, so something like this ...
          {
            id => "foo/schema",
            properties => {
                bar => { extends => { $ref => "#" } }
            }
          }
      will not work correctly because it would lead to a circular loop.
      However, this does work:
          {
            id => "foo/schema",
            properties => {
                bar => { $ref => "#" }
            }
          }
      the solution is to make another schema for 'bar' explicitly, however
      we do not properly throw an error now, which is bad.

== LOW PRIORITY ==

- Jackalope::Schema::Repository
    - we should be able to serialize the compiled_schemas to disk
      and then be able to load them instead of compiling them all
      might save on some of the startup overhead

- Jackalope.js
    - add some kind of basic Bread-Board type thing

- Jackalope::Schema::Spec & Jackalope.Schema.Spec
    - perhaps use that description cleanup method in GenerateSpec on the actual spec

- Test::Jackalope & Test.Jackalope
    - validation_fail should also take some kind of
      test to check the right error appears
        - fixtures will need to support this too

- test_fixtures
    - write more of them

- Jackalope::Schema::Validator::Core
    - make it use Moose types to check against
    - possibly just compile them down to faster subs or something

- Jackalope::Serializer
    - Jackalope::Serializer::XML (TODO - perigrin)
    - Jackalope::Serializer::YAML (why??)
